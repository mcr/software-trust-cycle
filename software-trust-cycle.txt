   Trust relationships and Trust Anchors for Software Updates, Remote
                       Attestation and Onboarding
          draft-richardson-secdispatch-software-trust-cycle-00

Abstract

   This document describes the different trust anchors that are required
   by current onboarding, remote attestation and software update
   mechanisms.

   While each mechanism needs anchors, it can also be used to provide
   anchors for the other mechanisms.  This document explores those
   relationships and how the can be leveraged to simplify secure
   management of devices.
